Generate a random sequence that you have to memorize within a short time frame! Test how accurate your memory is by inputing the corresponding keys that showed up. This project was an exercise for myself to gain practice with the [p5](https://p5js.org/) library.

How to play: 
* Game requires arrow-key input, meaning this game is not mobile-compatible.
* Select your difficulty. Difficulty influences how long the random sequence stays on the screen for.
* Select the desired sequence length. (Anywhere from 3 to 9).
* Click start to generate the sequence. After some time has elapsed, you will be able to input the keys.
* Green tiles represent correct inputs.
* Red tiles represent incorrect inputs.
* Don't worry if you mess up! You're still allowed to enter the next inputs even if you get a red tile.

To do:
* Add scoring system
* Make it look nicer
* Make sequence display duration scale with length?
